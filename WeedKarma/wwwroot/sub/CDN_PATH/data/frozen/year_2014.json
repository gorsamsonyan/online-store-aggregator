We support their goals of maintaining their &quot;NE Ohio Trails Forever,&quot; which has over 100 miles of hiking trails to observe nature. The CVNP Environmental Education Center brings underprivileged inner city kids to camp where they are encouraged to explore nature. They learn about preservation through the three R's: reduce, reuse, and recycle. Many of the kids have never been out of the city and this opens a whole new world to them. It really hits home when one of the kids sees or learns something about the world around them that was entirely unknown. Cascade Subaru is proud that their contributions to the park help these children grown and learn while allowing everyone to observe the beauty of the world around them.</p>\n","shortdesc":"Cascade Subaru celebrates the 10-year anniversary of their remarkable partnership with;
